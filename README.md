# vortec-irc-yahcolorize-script
IRC chat-client script that allows Vortec to communicate with YahCoLoRiZe

You can remotely change the YahCoLoRiZe chat-room (channel) and process text directly by adding some Aliases to Vortec.

In Vortec, click the Aliases tab then the +. Enter the name CCHAN and click OK. Paste in this line:

```
/ddepoke colorize command ddechan *1
```

Hit + again, enter CPLAY and click OK. Paste in this line:

```
/ddeplay colorize command ddeplay *1
```

Hit + again, enter CX and click OK. Paste in this line:

```
/ddepoke colorize command ddevtext *1
```

Now you can change the chat-room with /CCHAN #new-room, and send color-text with /CX my-line of chat text. You can also now use /CPLAY start|stop|pause|resume and /CPLAY <path of a text file>

If you are adventurous, instead of the above alias for CX, use this: /runscript [colorize] $activewin *1. To add the script that goes with this command, click the +, type [COLORIZE], in braces, and press OK. Paste in the script below and click the âœ”
